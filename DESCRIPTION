Description: This package, PSARseq, is designed for performing DE analysis by adjusting population stratification existing in RNA-seq data sets. The DE method is based on edgeR package in Bioconductor. What package dose is to evaluate proper confounding factors from the RNA-seq dataset and to use them in DE testing.
